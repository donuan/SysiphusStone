Sysiphus Stone
=============
Sysiphus Stone is an interactive video instalation made during the EASTN residency in Tsepelovo for the "Touching the Village" art show that was hold in the village center.

### Concept

In Greek mythology Sisyphus was a king of Ephyra (now known as Corinth) punished for chronic deceitfulness by being compelled to roll an immense boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, and to repeat this action forever.

Albert Camus, in his 1942 essay The Myth of Sisyphus, saw Sisyphus as personifying the absurdity of human life, but Camus concludes "one must imagine Sisyphus happy" as "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart." [1]

By interacting with the stone a video loop that always loops back is controled.
